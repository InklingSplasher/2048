## How to Play
### Playing
The goal of 2048 is to merge same powers of 2 to higher and higher numbers until you are able to merge 2 numbers into 2048.
You can move all numbers to how far they can go by using the arrow keys, WASD or just clicking the mouse at N E S W.
The game is over when the 4\*4 tile is full and no number can move any further.
### Cheat Mode
The Cheat Mode is like an easy mode for just trying out the game. Your highscore won't be saved and you are able to click on specific tiles to delete the numbers in them for an always-ongoing game.
