## How to Play
The goal of 2048 is to merge same powers of 2 to higher and higher numbers until you are able to merge 2 numbers into 2048.
You can move all numbers to how far they can go by using the arrow keys, WASD or just clicking the mouse at N E S W.
The game is over when the 4\*4 tile is full and no number can move any further.
